# This is a simple Bot playing MineSweeper build with Python and OpenCV
# still under construction ...
after many hours of struggling with opencv and windows i had to switch to python 2.7

MineSweeper from Microsoft. It can be downloaded from the windows Store
for Free. Link is comming...


This is the main code for my Mine Sweeper bot, that playing Mine Sweeper
from Microsoft on its own. In the end the bot should be able to recognize the
grid and the diiferent Values of the squares without giving him the exact images.

Actually the bot is far away from working. I try to code everyday some line, but
i donÂ´t know when this bot will be running.

The bot could be sliced in the following main tasks.

1. Start the Game
2. Read the Game and recognize whats going on
   - Loop, because the bot should know what happened after every click
3. Read different regions to evaluate, where mines are for sure to click NOT on
   this squares.
4. Game Logic:
   - apply the game rules
   - score the squares to find the bombs
5. Log every Game to find out how good the bot is

without the Help of this Tutorial https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-python-bot-that-can-play-web-games--active-11117 ,
i was not able to think about doing something like that.

The other guys how helped me out were not forget, the names/ links were be copied
when i have the time for.

i was also inspired by sentdex and his awesome "Python plays GTaV"
